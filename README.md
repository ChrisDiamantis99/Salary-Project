# Job Listings Analysis
This repository contains code for analyzing job listings from various companies. The data was obtained from Kaggle and contains information about the job title, salary estimate, job description, company rating, company name, location, headquarters, company size, year founded, type of ownership, industry, sector, revenue, competitors, and other factors.

## Data Cleaning
The data was cleaned using Python and several libraries such as Pandas. The data cleaning process included removing duplicates, filling missing values, standardizing data formats, and transforming the data into a more usable format.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The cleaned data was analyzed using Python and several libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The analysis included visualizations of various features such as the distribution of salaries, the most popular job titles, and the most common industries and sectors.

## Data Analysis
Data analytics models were trained on the cleaned data to predict the salary based on various factors such as job title, company size, industry, and others. The models used include linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost. The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error and R-squared.

## Conclusion
This project provides an in-depth analysis of job listings data and demonstrates how data analysis can be used to predict salaries based on various factors. The code and data can be found in this repository, and additional details can be found in the Jupyter Notebooks.
